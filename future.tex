\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:Future}

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:Approach:Overview}, we found our ideas of extending \Strata do not scale because we need information about the instruction, whose semantics we want to learn, in order to constraint the search space. This lesson intrigued us to a new idea, where the information needed to reduce the search space can be automatically extracted from the manual. This
 information does not need to be precise, and we believe that such a
rough information can be automatically extracted from the manual using text processing.  We plan to explore this idea while defining the semantics of
 unspecified and/or new instructions.
