\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

We have presented the most complete formal semantics of X86-64 user-level instructions
to date, which has been thoroughly tested and demonstrated  to be applicable
for different formal analyses such as symbolic execution, deductive
verification, and translation validation.
Moreover, the \K framework enables us to represent a semantics as SMT theories,
which other projects can
leverage for their own purposes.

%\K  has success stories about defining the formal semantics of production languages like C~\cite{KC} and LLVM~\cite{KLLVM}. We can use that towards the benefit of binary lifters like ~\cite{McSema:Recon14, FCD} which lifts the binary code to LLVM IR for binary analysis and/or optimization. Having the semantics of both the source (\ISA) and the target language(LLVM) help in verifying the translation using symbolic reasoning and hence enhance trust in  the translation.
