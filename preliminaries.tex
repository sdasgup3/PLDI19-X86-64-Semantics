\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:Prelim}

Here we provide background on the \K framework and the \Strata project~\cite{Heule2016a} (used for our baseline semantics).

% briefly explain pieces of \ISA ISA necessary for our
% presentation. We also talk about \K, a semantics engineering tool which we
% chose to formalize our semantics into and  \Strata which gives us a head-start towards modeling the semantics of \ISA instructions.
