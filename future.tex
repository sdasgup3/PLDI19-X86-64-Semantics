\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:Future}
The lesson that we learned from our failed effort in extending \Strata
intrigues us to a new idea of a hybrid approach, where the extra information
for reducing the search space is automatically extracted from the manual.  The
extra information does not need to be very precise, and we believe that such a
rough information can be automatically extracted from the manual using a simple
text processing.  We plan to apply this idea when we define the semantics of
the unspecified instructions and/or new instructions of the next version of
x86-64 ISA in the future.
